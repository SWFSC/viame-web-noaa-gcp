# Documentation for VIAME-Web in NOAA Fisheries Cloud

The site details how to run an instance of VIAME-Web (see [here](https://kitware.github.io/dive/#concepts-and-definitions) for a discussion of terms) on a NMFS-hardened VM in a [GCP Project](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/fisheriescloudservices/home) within the [NOAA Fisheries Cloud](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/nmfs-hq-ocio-cloud-portal/home). 

These instructions were developed from [DIVE Deployment Scenario 1](https://kitware.github.io/dive/Deployment-Provision/) with the extensive help and expertise of the VIAME team, in particular Brandon Davis and Bryon Lewis, and Ed Rodgers.
